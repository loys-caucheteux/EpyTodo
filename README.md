# EpyTodo
EpyTodo Epitech Project 2021

Here is a todo REST API I made for an Epitech project.

deploy : cd path/to/repo_dir && npm start

It is developed using ExpressJS.

## Bonus directory

deploy : cd path/to/bonus_dir/ && docker-compose up

A react App serves has the front-end by making HTTP request to the API.

I used Docker to containerize the API, the react app and a MySQL database.
